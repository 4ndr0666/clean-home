CleanHome ...clean your $HOME the easy way!
Homepage: http://cleanhome.sourceforge.net
-------------------------------------------
CleanHome - cleans up users $HOME directory by analyzing "." config-files/directories 
against a collaborative maintained database.
Its pluggable approach makes it easy to develop various extensions.
 For example extensions could provide general information about the investigated .-File/Dir 
or could process a directory in a very special way 
(e.g. clean up Browser cache in .mozilla upon users request). 

A list of currently existing plugins and further information is accessible via
the project website: http://cleanhome.sourceforge.net

Usage:
------
No Installation, No configfiles, No pollution of your system!
Just call "cleanhome.pl" from a shell.
