# "CleanHome" by Henning Mersch -- http://www.henning-mersch.de.

## **Adaptation** and corrections for a dead and broken package

### It essentially cleans up your $HOME dir by taking a initial inventory of every single item you have in it. It then maintains this database locally, and tracks 
all changes in the dir. It then offers 4 services ranging from the ability to analyzing, archive, audit and use the net to find out what a file is.

---
Its written in perl obviously and makes it easy to develop your own functions and extensions really allowing you to make the tools you own. I has a good 
basis for a high usefull utility and service. Highly recommended! For example extensions could provide general information about the investigated .-File/Dir 
or could process a directory in a very special way 
(e.g. clean up Browser cache in .mozilla upon users request). 

Usage:
------
No Installation, No configfiles, No pollution of your system!
Just call "cleanhome.pl" from a shell.
